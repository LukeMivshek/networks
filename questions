Did I do the Makefile right? (NETARP)

What should this table look like in include.h?
	whats the right way to do this?
	what kind of data entry/removing are we doing (adding to 1st spot, kicking out last)

Do we need another daemon in addition to arpDaemon to do the 3 tries?

what is the ' file in include
